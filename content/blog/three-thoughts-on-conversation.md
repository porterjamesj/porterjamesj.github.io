I've been thinking about conversation a lot lately—what is it for?
what does it mean to be good at it? etc.

I certainly don't have all the answers or even any coherent thoughts
of my own really, but here are a few thoughts from other people that
I've found interesting and been mulling over or trying to apply
lately.

----

The first is from a podcast about language my coworker
[Allie](http://alliejon.es/) put me onto called
[The Allusionist](http://www.theallusionist.org), by Helen
Zaltzman. In her
[episode about small talk](http://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/smalltalk),
she touches on the idea that, while there's wide agreement about small
talk is in a literal sense, there's substantial room for disagreement
about what small talk is *for*, why we do it:

> But what IS being good at small talk? Is it the ability to keep a
> light conversation going for as long as possible without ever
> touching on any matters of substance, or is it being able to move
> from small talk to big talk very swiftly? You and the person you're
> small talking with might not have the same expectations or
> objectives.

Different goals can result in discomfort for everyone involved.

Some who view small talk as a sort of conversational on-ramp think of
in a explicitly strategic way—how can I use this small talk to get to
my goal of a more substantial conversation?

For example, here's one of the interviewees on the show explaining why
they make small talk:

> AMY: Because I try to get into it straight away, they back right off
> it, back towards small talk. And they’re baffled that I tried to
> talk about something of substance in a short space of time.
>

Another example:

> AVERY: To understand who someone is and how to get to that place,
> you have to know how they’re doing today; what they do for a
> living. To touch base and set up a rapport first.
>
> HZ: So what you’re saying is it creates an equality between the
> people in the conversation. If you do the small talk, you can
> establish the level the conversation’s going to be on.
>
> AVERY: Yeah. If you want to have a substantive conversation, this is
> a way of assessing where their brain is coming from.


The whole episode is worth a listen.

The second thought, which is related, comes from my friend
Rachel. Like some of the Allusionist interviewees, she's interested in
having "serious" conversations, but her strategy for doing so is very
different than the standard small talk approach, in fact it attempts
to side step small talk entirely.

What she does is to try and think of conversation not as space filler,
but as a game in which the goal is to glean the most information about
what makes someone unique or interesting in as little time as
possible. To do this, she tries to come up with questions to ask in
conversation that might seem innocuous or silly, but which can quickly
lead to interesting and revealing discussion. For example:

> You have the opportunity to ask a question about the world 100 years
> into the future. You will receive a one page, single spaced
> response. You can trust this information to be as accurate and
> unbiased as possible. What question do you ask?

She tries out a bunch of questions in different conversations, and
when she hits on one that works well, she remembers it for future
use. This gives her an arsenal of questions to use, as well as making
the questions she remembers more useful over time, since once she's
discussed a question a few times she's better equipped to guide her
interlocutor through an interesting line of thinking to get the
conversation to a place of satisfying depth.

Rachel's strategy is a really interesting one, and looking back on
conversations between the two of us, I can see how a lot of really
interesting discussion came out of her successful use of it. I have
been bugging her to write a more in depth post herself, detailing more
of the questions she uses and how they work, hopefully you be able to
read that soon!

The third thought comes from [Paul Ford](http://www.ftrain.com/), who
you may know as the author of
[*What is Code?*](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/). He
has
[a post about politeness](https://medium.com/message/how-to-be-polite-9bf1e69e888c)
which I really enjoyed, especially the bits about politeness in
conversation. For example he talks about how politeness is *useful*,
in the same way that small talk and Rachel's question list are useful:

> I figured there was a big world out there and etiquette was going to
> come in handy along the way. It didn’t at first . . . But then,
> suddenly — it mattered. My ability to go to a party and speak to
> anyone about anything, to natter and ask questions, to turn the
> conversation relentlessly towards the speaker, meant that **I was
> gathering huge amounts of information about other people**.

(emphasis mine)

He also talks about a "polite person's trick", which I really like:

> Here’s a polite person’s trick, one that has never failed me. I will
> share it with you because I like and respect you, and it is clear to
> me that you’ll know how to apply it wisely: When you are at a party
> and are thrust into conversation with someone, see how long you can
> hold off before talking about what they do for a living. And when
> that painful lull arrives, be the master of it. I have come to revel
> in that agonizing first pause, because I know that I can push a
> conversation through. Just ask the other person what they do, and
> right after they tell you, say: “Wow. That sounds hard.”  Because
> nearly everyone in the world believes their job to be difficult.

And another:

> A friend and I came up with a game called Raconteur. You pair up
> with another Raconteur at a party and talk to everyone you can. You
> score points by getting people to disclose something about their
> lives. If you dominate the conversation, you lose a point. The two
> raconteurs communicate using hand signals and keep a tally on a
> sheet of paper or in their minds. You’d think people would notice
> but they are so amused by the attention that the fact you’re playing
> Raconteur escapes their attention.

The post is about a lot of things, but a big theme is that being
polite in large part means having empathy for whoever might you find
yourself talking to—listening and genuinely wanting to hear about
their life, what makes them happy or sad, the minutiae of their
day. Again, the whole post is great and worth reading in its
entirety.
