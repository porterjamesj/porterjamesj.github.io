Title: One year at RC

Summary: I gush about where I work
Status: draft

I've been working at the Recurse Center for a year.

This isn't much of a milestone in the grand scheme of things, but it's
important to me. I've never felt as happy and excited about working
somewhere a year in as I do about RC.

I'm happy my coworkers are sharp and focused and get things done but
also kind, thoughtful, interesting people who know how to support each
other and give each other feedback.

I'm happy I get to do a bunch of different things at work. In the last
year I've planned and run events, written and edited copy,
live-transcribed talks, done page layout, programmed, assembled LEGOs,
painted walls, hung curtains, and been an advisor, confident, and
makeshift therapist to a lot of people.

I'm happy my work teaches me a lot about communities, learning, and
creative process.

I'm happy I get to meet so many smart, kind, wacky, fascinating
people.

I'm happy I work on something that advances a radically different
vision of how something important (education) could work.

Most of all I'm happy my work sustains and grows a community that I
and many others find tremendously valuable in a lot of different ways.

Here's to all the years to come
