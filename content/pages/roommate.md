Hi! I am looking for a roommate to share my small but cozy Morningside
Heights / UWS apartment.

**About the apartment**

  - On
    [109th between Amsterdam and Broadway](https://www.google.com/maps/search/109th+between+amsterdam+and+broadway+new+york+city). It's
    an odd place neighborhood-wise. The block isn't
    recognizably Morningside Heights, Harlem, or the Upper West
    Side, but you can easily walk to all three.
  - 2 bedroom. You have the smaller room, I the larger.
  - Your rent is $1300 a month (I pay slightly more due to having a
    larger room). This includes all bills except internet and
    electric, which are both around $50 per month.
  - Lease starting June 1st.

*Pros*

  - Dishwasher!
  - Laundry in the building. It's in the basement and you have to walk
    outside briefly to get there, but still much better than going to a
    laundromat.
  - No noisy neighbors.
  - I haven't had a problem with the building or the landlord in a
    year of living here.
  - Gets quite a bit of natural light due to being on the 5th floor.
  - Living with just one other person is nice. If your roommate is
    busy enough (I am) it's almost like having a place to yourself,
    but much cheaper.
  - Close to Absolute Bagels, Koronet Pizza, Columbia University,
    Central Park, Morningside Park, Riverside Park and the bike path,
    a post office, a great 24-hour grocery store, and a sizable NYPL
    branch.
  - Very well connected to transit. Right around the corner from the
    Cathedral Parkway 1 train stop; walking distance from the B, C,
    and 2/3 trains.

*Cons*

  - Small. But it has a nice vibe nonetheless. I like to say it's
    "small but cozy". Your room is also small. There's space for a
    queen size bed, a bookshelf, a nightstand, and not much else. It
    does have a reasonably sized closet.
  - 5th floor walkup. It's good exercise!
  - Not close to much of anything hip/cool/nightlife (bars or the
    like). There are a couple student bars (Lion's Head and 1020) that
    aren't bad.
  - Not a lot of storage. There are closets in each bedroom, but none
    in the common spaces. We make do between a lot of kitchen
    cabinet space, hooks, and various shelving units.

The living/dining room. You can see a bit of my room through the open
door. The table is bar-height.

The kitchen.  It's a bit narrow, but there's plenty of cabinets and
counter space (some not pictured here due to angle), and a dishwasher!

Your room. Small, as I said.

It does have a closet though.

**About me**

I work full time in SoHo at an educational retreat for programmers,
which keeps me pretty busy during the week. I leave around 9am, get
home at 7pm at the earliest, and often stay until 9pm or later.

I like reading books, listening to music, programming computers,
bicycling, lunch, playing tabletop games, and spending a lot of time
with friends.

Here's a list of facts that might be pros or cons for you depending:

  - I have a relatively quiet and laid back lifestyle; I don't have
    loud parties with a lot of people. Occasionally I'll have a few
    friends over for dinner or board games but that's about it.
  - I'm relatively clean, but not a neat freak, and the apartment
    reflects this. It's usually not spic-and-span but not a disaster
    zone either.
  - I do eat meat and I try to cook a few times a week.
  - I occasionally have friends from out of town stay for a few days
    and sleep on the couch, you're welcome to do the same.
  - I don't smoke, but I do drink and keep alcohol in the apartment.
  - I'm out of town for the weekend once every month or two visiting
    friends in Philadelphia.


**About you**

I'd like to find someone kind, thoughtful, with good judgment and a
similar-ish lifestyle to my own: working or going to school full time,
relatively quiet and laid back, non-smoker, no pets.

I'm also looking for someone who wants to sign a full year lease, not
sublet.
