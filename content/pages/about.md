Title: about
Slug: about

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Chicago, studying Biology and Computer Science.

I also work as a developer for the [Laboratory for Advanced Computation](http://www.labcomputing.org/) on the
[Open Science Data Cloud](https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/) project, which is a cloud computing resource
developed in the open and aimed at serving the needs of scientific researchers in a variety of disciplines.

In the past I have worked in a [fruit fly genetics laboratory](http://benmay.uchicago.edu/faculty/rebay); I was
also a student at [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com) in the summer of 2013.
