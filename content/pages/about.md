I'm currently a Software Engineer at the University of Chicago
[Center for Data Intensive Science](http://cdis.uchicago.edu/),
working on the
[NCI Genomic Data Commons](http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/newsfromnci/2014/GenomicDataCommonsNewsNote). I
recently graduated from the University of Chicago, where I studied
biology and computer science.

I was an intern at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), where I worked on
the financial operations team, for the summer of
2014. While in school I worked on the
[Open Science Data Cloud](https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/)
project.I was a student at
[Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com) in the summer
of 2013. Before that I worked in a
[fruit fly genetics laboratory](http://benmay.uchicago.edu/faculty/rebay)
doing wetlab and computational research on the mechanisms of
transcriptional repression.
