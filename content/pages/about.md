Slug: about

I recently graduated from the University of Chicago, where I studied
biology and computer science. I will be an intern at
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for the summer of 2014.

While in school I worked as a developer on the
[Open Science Data Cloud](https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/)
project. I also used to work in a
[fruit fly genetics laboratory](http://benmay.uchicago.edu/faculty/rebay).
I was a student at [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com) in the
summer of 2013.
