I graduated in 2014 from the University of Chicago, where I studied
Biology and Computer Science. While in school I worked part time in a
[fruit fly genetics laboratory](http://benmay.uchicago.edu/faculty/rebay)
and on cloud computing infrastructure for bioinformatics. After
graduating I interned at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for a summer,
then returned to UChicago, where I worked on the National Cancer
Institute [Genomic Data Commons](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov).

I'm currently a facilitator at the
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), to which you should
[apply](https://www.recurse.com/apply) if you'd like to become a
dramatically better programmer and have a lot of fun doing so.
