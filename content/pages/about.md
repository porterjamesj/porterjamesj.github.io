I am an undergraduate student at the University of Chicago, studying Biology and Computer Science.

This summer I am at [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com) learning to program for real.

Other interests include outdoorsmanship, tabletop games, and [the Scavenger Hunt](http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu)
