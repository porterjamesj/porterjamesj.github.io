Slug: about

I'm currently a Software Engineer at the University of Chicago
[Center for Data Intensive Science](http://cdis.uchicago.edu/),
working on the
[NCI Genomic Data Commons](http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/newsfromnci/2014/GenomicDataCommonsNewsNote)
project. I recently graduated from the University of Chicago, where I
studied biology and computer science.

I was an intern at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), where I worked on
the financial operations team, for the summer of
2014. While in school I worked on the
[Open Science Data Cloud](https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/). I
spent the summer of 2013 at the
[Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com).  Before that I worked in
a
[fruit fly genetics laboratory](http://benmay.uchicago.edu/faculty/rebay)
doing wetlab and computational research on the mechanisms of
transcriptional repression.
